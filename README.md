# Alzemist
A Deep Learning Model to see which classifies Brain MRI on the basis of the dementia (AD). The images are classified as follows - Mildly Demented, Moderate Demented, Non Demented, Very Mild Demented.

## Overview : Alzemist
The Brain MRI data for the project was taken from the Kaggle dataset <__here__>. It can be used to classify MRI into Mildly Demented, Moderate Demented, Non Demented, Very Mild Demented. Since    

### Why Alzeimer's ?
Alzeimer's(AD), according to the exact definition - is a type of dementia that effects memory, thinking and behavior. The general hypothesis regarding AD is that it prevents internal parts of cells from running well. 

In the Barin MRI data, two abnormal structures are obtained - namely plaques and tangles which are the prime suspects in damaging and killing cells. The exact role of these structures is unknown, but there is a correlation between these structures and AD.

- Plaques are deposits of protein fragment called Beta-Amyloid that builds up in the spaces between nerve cells.

- Tangles are twisted fibres of protein called tau that builds up inside the cells. 

People with AD tend to develop far more of these abnormal structures and in a predictable pattern - beginning in the areas important for memory and then spreading to other parts of the brain.

The image here shows the difference between a normal brain(left) to one that has AD. As the disease progresses, the shrinkage of the brain continues - increasing the severity of the symptoms.

### The Making Of : Alzeimist
Alzemist is something that has been on top of my mind for a long time. Neurodegenrative disorders, or in general the ability of lose control of your mind is one of my biggest fears. While I can't help cure it, I can do something that I am half good at and Alzemist is just that.
